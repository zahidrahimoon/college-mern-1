> **A Unique, Full-Stack MERN Project**  
> This is a production-level project that includes a fully responsive frontend, a robust backend, and an intuitive admin panel. It is a comprehensive college website featuring all necessary pages and functionalities to serve as an academic portal.


## Overview

This project is a complete MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application, uniquely built and designed from scratch. It features all the pages you'd expect from a modern college website, such as home, about, courses, events, contact, and more. The admin panel provides robust management functionalities to maintain content, manage users, and oversee site operations. Every component of the project—from the smooth animations on the frontend to the secure API endpoints on the backend—has been crafted with production-level code practices.
